# Breast Cancer METABRIC: Predicting Patient Survival
This project analyzes the Breast Cancer METABRIC dataset to predict patient survival outcomes based on clinical and biomarker data. Using Python, I applied machine learning techniques to create a model that identifies key features impacting survival and evaluated the modelâ€™s performance through metrics like accuracy and ROC AUC.

## Project Overview
* Objective: To predict patient survival based on clinical features and biomarkers using the Breast Cancer METABRIC dataset.
* Technologies Used: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib), Machine Learning (Random Forest), Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, and Visualization.
## Steps in the Project
* Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and dropped columns with significant missing data.
* Feature Engineering: Imputed missing values and normalized numerical features.
* Modeling: Trained a Random Forest model to predict survival outcomes, achieving high accuracy and ROC AUC.
* Evaluation: Assessed model performance through accuracy, ROC AUC score, and feature importance analysis.
* Visualizations: Visualized feature importance and survival outcome distribution to provide insights.
## Key Results
* Accuracy: Achieved a strong accuracy score in predicting patient survival.
* Feature Importance: Identified key clinical features and biomarkers most strongly associated with survival
